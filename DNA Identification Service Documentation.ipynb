    "# DNA Identification Service Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This DNA identification service aims to identify the closest sequence in a provided database to a given test sequence. The service considers various methods, including sequence comparison, statistical analysis, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "- **Code Files**:\n",
    "  - `dna_identification.py`: Main script for DNA identification service.\n",
    "  - `align_sequences.py`: Script for aligning DNA sequences using ClustalW.\n",
    "- **Input Files**:\n",
    "  - `dog_breeds.fa`: Database file containing DNA sequences adapted from GEO.\n",
    "  - `mystery.fa`: Test sequence file to be identified.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - Closest sequence identification results and differences.\n",
    "  - Probability and p-value analysis.\n",
    "  - Phylogenetic tree visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. DNA Identification (`dna_identification.py`)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Identify the closest sequence in the database to the test sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Reading Fasta Files**:\n",
    "   - Read the database sequences and the test sequence from their respective FASTA files.\n",
    "   - Use `read_fasta_file()` function to parse FASTA files and return sequences as dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Calculate probabilities of observing each base at each position in the database using `calculate_probabilities()` function.\n",
    "   - Calculate the p-value for the test sequence against the database using `calculate_p_value()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Closest Sequence Identification**:\n",
    "   - Find the sequence with the smallest p-value as the closest sequence.\n",
    "   - Calculate the difference between the test sequence and the closest sequence.\n",
    "   - Output the closest sequence, difference, and p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Sequence Alignment (`align_sequences.py`)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Align DNA sequences using ClustalW.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Sequence Alignment**:\n",
    "   - Perform sequence alignment using ClustalW.\n",
    "   - Input the database sequences file.\n",
    "   - Output the aligned sequences file (`aligned_sequences.aln`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Phylogenetic Tree Construction (`dna_identification.py`)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Construct a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Tree Construction**:\n",
    "   - Read the aligned sequences from the alignment file using `read_aligned_sequences()` function.\n",
    "   - Construct the phylogenetic tree using the UPGMA method.\n",
    "   - Visualize the tree using the `Phylo.draw()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stretch Goals\n",
    "- **Stretch Goal 1: Probabilities and p-value**:\n",
    "  - Implemented in the `dna_identification.py` script.\n",
    "  - Calculates probabilities and p-values to assess sequence similarity statistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stretch Goal 2: Phylogenetic Tree**:\n",
    "  - Implemented in the `dna_identification.py` script.\n",
    "  - Constructs a phylogenetic tree to visualize evolutionary relationships between sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The DNA identification service offers a comprehensive solution for identifying the closest sequence in a provided database to a test sequence. It employs various methods, including sequence comparison, statistical analysis, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction, to achieve accurate results.\n",
